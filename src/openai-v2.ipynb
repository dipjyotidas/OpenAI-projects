      "Hi there, Logan, thank you for joining us on the show today. Thanks for having me. I'm super excited about this. Brilliant. We're going to dive right in, and I think ChatGPT is maybe the most famous AI product that you have at OpenAI, but I'd just like to get an overview of what all the other AIs that are available are. So I think two and a half years ago, OpenAI released the API that we still have available today, which is essentially our giving people access to these models. And for a lot of people, giving people access to the model that powers ChatGPT, which is our consumer-facing first-party application, which essentially just, in very simple terms, puts a nice UI on top of what was already available through our API for the last two and a half years. So it's sort of democratizing the access to this technology through our API. If you want to just play around with it, as an end user, we have ChatGPT available to the world as well.\n"
