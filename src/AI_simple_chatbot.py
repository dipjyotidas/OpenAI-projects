#Example Chatbot response:

# User:  Explain what pi is.
# Assistant:  Pi (Ï€) is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. In simpler terms, pi is the number you get when you divide the distance around a circle by the distance across it. 
# It is an irrational number, meaning it cannot be expressed as a fraction and its decimal representation goes on forever without repeating.

# Pi is approximately equal to 3.14159, but it is infinitely long and has been calculated to millions and even billions of decimal places using computers.      

# User:  Summarize this in two bullet points.
# Assistant:  - Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.
# - It is an irrational number, approximately equal to 3.14159, with an infinite and non-repeating decimal representation.
